📖**ReadME**

Y2M is very simple in use app for downloading audio from YouTube videos in MP3 file. App allows you to quickly and easily get audio files from videos by saving them in the Downloads folder. In the future I plan to make it available for download in mp4 format!

❔**How to**

If you want just to use app and not to work with source code you can download it [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Xv76stF2M7_f2P-KpkSNrF3Wl4ncsRul/view?usp=sharing).

📃**Source code.**

If you want to use source code (uncompiled file) you need to install some modules:
1. yt-dlp
2. pillow
3. tkinter

Here is a command to install them all!

```pip install yt-dlp pillow tkinter```

̶F̶F̶M̶p̶e̶g̶ ̶a̶l̶s̶o̶ ̶r̶e̶q̶u̶i̶r̶e̶d̶!̶    It is not required now.

⚠️**Attention!**

App doesn't safe any personal data and just uses YouTube API to get information about video. There are also some little bugs which I will try to fix in the future!
